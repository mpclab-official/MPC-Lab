## Intro
What we develop is a website, or a powerful Web-APP, about mathematics, physics and chemistry. It can help students learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and can also help teachers teach. The main function of my website is a powerful question generator, covering mathematics, physics and chemistry from elementary school to college entry. 90% of the question types are randomly generated and not drawn from the question bank. About 1,000 parameters can be provided to teachers for selection. Generator models have thousands of parameters. More targeted. On average, tens of thousands of questions can be generated per second. After generation, it supports one-click assignment and one-click generation of PDF. The website also has many tools related to mathematics and physics, such as matrix calculators, n-dimensional equation calculators, acceleration calculators, celestial body motion models/simulators, etc. The website can support registering users, creating classes, inviting students to join, assigning homework, etc. There is also an exam system that can detect students' cheating behaviors, such as exiting full screen, switching windows, etc. The entire project has more than 30,000 lines of code, and the development time is one and a half months. As a team of two, I personally develop for an average of more than 9 hours a day, and the total number of submissions exceeds 2,000. Our vision is to improve the relevance of mathematics, physics and chemistry education, stimulate students' interest, and improve the country's talents in this area.
