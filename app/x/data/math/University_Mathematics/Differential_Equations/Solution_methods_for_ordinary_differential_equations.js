Solution methods for ordinary differential equations

Inputs:
- C_exact (boolean): Determines if questions related to exact differential equations should be included.
- C_linear (boolean): Determines if questions related to linear differential equations should be included.
- C_bernoulli (boolean): Determines if questions related to Bernoulli differential equations should be included.
- C_substitution (boolean): Determines if questions related to substitution methods should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to various solution methods for ordinary differential equations. It covers topics such as exact differential equations, linear differential equations, Bernoulli differential equations, and substitution methods. The questions may involve finding solutions using specific techniques and methods for different types of ordinary differential equations.

Example Usage:
const result = SolutionMethodsODE(true, false, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Solve the Bernoulli differential equation dy/dx - y/x = y^2 * ln(x)', 'The solution to the Bernoulli differential equation is y = 1 / (C - ln(x)).']
*/

$X.math.University_Mathematics.Differential_Equations.SolutionMethodsODE = function (C_exact, C_linear, C_bernoulli, C_substitution) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
