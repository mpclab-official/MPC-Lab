/*
Higher-order differential equations

Inputs:
- C_homogeneous (boolean): Determines if questions related to homogeneous differential equations should be included.
- C_nonhomogeneous (boolean): Determines if questions related to nonhomogeneous differential equations should be included.
- C_boundary_value (boolean): Determines if questions related to boundary value problems should be included.
- C_initial_value (boolean): Determines if questions related to initial value problems should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to higher-order differential equations. It covers topics such as homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations, boundary value problems, and initial value problems. The questions may involve finding solutions to specific types of differential equations, applying boundary conditions, and handling initial values.

Example Usage:
const result = HigherOrderDifferentialEquations(true, false, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Find the particular solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation y'''' - 2y'' + y = e^x', 'The particular solution is y_p = (1/2) * e^x.']
*/

$X.math.University_Mathematics.Differential_Equations.HigherOrderDifferentialEquations = function (C_homogeneous, C_nonhomogeneous, C_boundary_value, C_initial_value) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
