Random variables and probability distributions

Inputs:
- C_discrete (boolean): Determines if questions related to discrete probability distributions should be included.
- C_continuous (boolean): Determines if questions related to continuous probability distributions should be included.
- C_expectation (boolean): Determines if questions related to the calculation of expectations should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to random variables and probability distributions. It covers topics such as discrete and continuous probability distributions, as well as the calculation of expectations for various distributions. The questions may involve finding probabilities, expected values, and variance for different types of random variables and distributions.

Example Usage:
const result = RandomVariablesAndDistributions(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Calculate the expectation for the discrete probability distribution given by the table... ', 'The expectation for the given discrete probability distribution is ... ']
