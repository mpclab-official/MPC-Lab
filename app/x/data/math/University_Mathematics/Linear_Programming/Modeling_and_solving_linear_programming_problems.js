/*
Modeling and solving linear programming problems

Inputs:
- LP_modeling (boolean): Determines if questions related to modeling linear programming problems should be included.
- LP_solving (boolean): Determines if questions related to solving linear programming problems should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the modeling and solving of linear programming problems. It covers topics such as the formulation of objective functions, constraints, and the graphical and analytical methods used to find optimal solutions. The questions may involve understanding the simplex algorithm, duality, and sensitivity analysis.

Example Usage:
const result = LinearProgramming(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Explain the simplex algorithm...', 'The simplex algorithm is a method for...']
