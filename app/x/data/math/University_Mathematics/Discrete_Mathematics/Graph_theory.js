/*
Graph Theory

Inputs:
- graph_properties (boolean): Determines if questions related to graph properties should be included.
- graph_algorithms (boolean): Determines if questions related to graph algorithms should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties of graphs and various graph algorithms. It covers topics such as connectivity, paths, cycles, spanning trees, and various graph traversal and search algorithms. Questions may also involve understanding graph representations and their applications in different fields.

Example Usage:
const result = GraphTheory(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Explain what a spanning tree is...', 'A spanning tree of a graph G is...']
