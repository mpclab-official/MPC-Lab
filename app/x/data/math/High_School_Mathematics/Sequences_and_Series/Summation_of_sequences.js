/*
Summation of sequences

Inputs:
- C_arithmetic (boolean): Determines if arithmetic sequences should be included.
- C_geometric (boolean): Determines if geometric sequences should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the summation of arithmetic and geometric sequences based on the specified input values. It can include questions about finding the sum of the first n terms of sequences. The questions are designed to assess the user's understanding of these fundamental concepts in sequences. The answers are provided in a clear and concise manner to help users verify their solutions.

Example Usage:
const result = SummationOfSequences(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ...', 'The sum is 145.']

PS: The answer should be in fractions (Katex), using GCF to calculate the simplest fraction.
