/*
Properties and graphs of trigonometric functions

Inputs:
- C_sine (boolean): Determines if sine properties should be included.
- C_cosine (boolean): Determines if cosine properties should be included.
- C_tangent (boolean): Determines if tangent properties should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties and graphs(formula) of trigonometric functions based on the specified input values. It randomly selects whether to include properties of sine, cosine, or tangent functions and generates corresponding questions and answers for each property.

The function ensures that the question is provided in a clear format and the answer is calculated accurately based on the generated question.

Example Usage:
const result = PropertiesAndGraphsOfTrigonometricFunctions(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Given the sine value is 0.45, find the angle in degrees.', 'The angle is approximately 27 degrees.']

PS: The answer should be in fractions (Katex), using GCF to calculate the simplest fraction.
