/*
Decimal Addition (with multiple consecutive additions)

Description:
This function generates an addition problem involving decimal numbers, with the option to add multiple numbers consecutively. It returns both the problem statement and the answer.

Inputs:
- min (number): The minimum value for the random numbers.
- max (number): The maximum value for the random numbers.
- numCount (number): The number of decimal numbers to add.
- decimalPlaces (number): The number of decimal places for the generated numbers.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the problem statement and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Addition(1, 10, 3, 2);
console.log(result); // Output: ['2.34 + 5.67 + 6.78 = ?', 14.79] // The answer is calculated based on the generated random decimal numbers.

/*
Decimal Addition with Context (with multiple consecutive additions)

Description:
This function generates an addition problem involving decimal numbers with context, allowing for multiple consecutive additions. It returns both the problem description and the answer.

Inputs:
- min (number): The minimum value for the random numbers.
- max (number): The maximum value for the random numbers.
- numCount (number): The number of decimal numbers to add.
- decimalPlaces (number): The number of decimal places for the generated numbers.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the problem description and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Addition_w(1, 10, 3, 2);
console.log(result); // Output: ['In a recipe, you have 3 ingredients. If you add 2.34 + 5.67 + 6.78, what is the total quantity?', 14.79] // The answer is calculated based on the generated random decimal numbers.

Decimal Subtraction (with multiple consecutive subtractions)

Description:
This function generates a subtraction problem involving decimal numbers, with the option to subtract multiple numbers consecutively. It returns both the problem statement and the answer.

Inputs:
- min (number): The minimum value for the random numbers.
- max (number): The maximum value for the random numbers.
- numCount (number): The number of decimal numbers to subtract.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the problem statement and the answer.

Example Usage:
