Shape Recognition

Description:
This function identifies a shape based on some random data or description. It randomly selects a shape from the given list and provides a description of that shape. It then asks the user to identify the shape based on the description.

Inputs:
- square (boolean): Whether to include a square in the options.
- triangle (boolean): Whether to include a triangle in the options.
- circle (boolean): Whether to include a circle in the options.
- rectangle (boolean): Whether to include a rectangle in the options.
- parallelogram (boolean): Whether to include a parallelogram in the options.
- pentagon (boolean): Whether to include a pentagon in the options.
- hexagon (boolean): Whether to include a hexagon in the options.
- heptagon (boolean): Whether to include a heptagon in the options.
- octagon (boolean): Whether to include an octagon in the options.
- oval (boolean): Whether to include an oval in the options.
- rhombus (boolean): Whether to include a rhombus in the options.
- trapezoid (boolean): Whether to include a trapezoid in the options.
- semicircle (boolean): Whether to include a semicircle in the options.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the problem statement and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Recognizing_shapes(true, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What shape is described as follows: A shape with four right angles and two long sides and two short side.', 'Rectangle']
