/*
Circle Chord Distance

Description:
This function generates a problem related to the distance from the point of intersection of two chords to the center of a circle. It randomly selects lengths for two chords and a distance to the center of the circle, then calculates the distance from the point of intersection to the circle's center. The function constructs a question and answer based on the generated values and returns them as an array.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = CircleChordDistance();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["Given two chords of lengths 6 units and 3 units, both at a distance of 4 units from the center of the circle, find the distance from the point of intersection to the center of the circle. Round to the nearest hundredth.", "The distance from the intersection point of the chords to the center of the circle is 4.50 units."]
// The question involves calculating the distance from the point of intersection of two chords to the center of the circle, and the answer provides the calculated distance.
