/*
Trapezoid Height

Description:
This function generates a problem related to finding the height of a trapezoid. It randomly generates the values for the area, upper base, and lower base of the trapezoid within specific ranges. Using these values, it calculates the height of the trapezoid and constructs a question asking the user to find the height. It also provides the formula for calculating the height of a trapezoid in the answer. The function returns the question and answer in an array.

Example Usage:
const result = TrapezoidHeight();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["A trapezoid has an area of 175, an upper base of 17, and a lower base of 10. Calculate the height of this trapezoid.", "Use the trapezoid area formula: (2 * area) / (upper base + lower base), substitute the values to get 14."]
