/*
Similarity of Shapes

Description:
This function generates a problem related to the similarity of shapes. It considers various shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, and rhombuses. The function randomly selects whether to focus on side length or angle measure based on the provided boolean values. It then constructs a question regarding the corresponding properties of similar shapes and provides an answer based on the random properties generated. The function returns the question and answer in an array.

Example Usage:
const result = Similarity(true, false, true, false, false, true, false, false);
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["Rhombus ABCD is similar to rhombus EFGH with a scale factor of 2.6. If the side length of ABCD is 9 units, find the side length of EFGH.", "Since rhombus ABCD is similar to rhombus EFGH with a scale factor of 2.6, the side length of EFGH is 23.4 units. The side length of EFGH is found by multiplying the scale factor by the side length of ABCD."]
// The question involves finding the side length of a rhombus EFGH based on the provided information, and the answer explains the process of finding the side length using the scale factor.
