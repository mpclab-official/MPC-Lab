/*
Circle Arc Length

Description:
This function generates a problem related to the calculation of the arc length in a circle. It randomly generates a diameter and an angle within specified ranges, constructs a question based on them, and calculates the arc length using the appropriate formula. The answer is then provided, rounded to two decimal places.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = CircleArcLength();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ['In a circle with diameter 7 units, if the central angle is 120 degrees, find the arc length. Round to the nearest hundredth.', 'The arc length of a circle with a diameter of 7 units and a central angle of 120 degrees is 7.33 units.']
// The question asks for the calculation of the arc length, and the answer provides the result rounded to two decimal places.
