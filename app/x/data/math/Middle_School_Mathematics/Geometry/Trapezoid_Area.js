/*
Trapezoid Area

Description:
This function generates a problem related to finding the area of a trapezoid. It randomly generates the values for the upper base, lower base, and height of the trapezoid within specific ranges. Using these values, it calculates the area of the trapezoid and constructs a question asking the user to find the area. It also provides the formula for calculating the area of a trapezoid in the answer. The function returns the question and answer in an array.

Example Usage:
const result = TrapezoidArea();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["The upper base of a trapezoid is 15, the lower base is 8, and the height is 12. Calculate the area of this trapezoid.", "Use the trapezoid area formula: ((upper base + lower base) * height) / 2, substitute the values to get 126."]
