/*
Perimeter of Triangle

Description:
This function generates a problem related to the perimeter of a triangle. It randomly selects three side lengths, calculates the perimeter, and constructs a question and answer based on the generated values. The function returns the question and answer in an array.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = TrianglePerimeter();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["Given three sides of lengths 4 units, 5 units, and 6 units, find the perimeter of the triangle. Round to the nearest hundredth.", "The perimeter of a triangle with side lengths 4 units, 5 units, and 6 units is 15 units."]
// The question involves finding the perimeter of a triangle with given side lengths, and the answer provides the calculated perimeter.
