/*
Corresponding Angles

Description:
This function generates a problem related to corresponding angles in a given geometric figure. It randomly selects angle values and constructs a question and answer based on the generated angles. The function returns the question and the corresponding answer.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Corresponding_angles();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ["In the given figure, if ∠1 and ∠2 are corresponding angles, and the measure of ∠1 is 60 degrees, what is the measure of ∠2?", "The measure of ∠2 is 60 degrees."]
// The question involves corresponding angles in a geometric figure, and the answer provides the measure of ∠2 based on the given measure of ∠1.
