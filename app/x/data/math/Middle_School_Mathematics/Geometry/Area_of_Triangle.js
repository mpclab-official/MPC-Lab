/*
Triangle Area

Description:
This function generates a problem related to the calculation of the area of a triangle. It randomly generates the base and height within specified ranges, constructs a question based on these values, calculates the area using the appropriate formula, and provides the answer rounded to two decimal places.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = TriangleArea();
console.log(result);
// Example output: ['Consider a triangle with base 6 units and height 4 units. Find the area of the triangle. Round to the nearest hundredth.', 'The area of a triangle with base 6 units and height 4 units is 12.00 square units.']
// The question asks for the calculation of the area, and the answer provides the result rounded to two decimal places.
