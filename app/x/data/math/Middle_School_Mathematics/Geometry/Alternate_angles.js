/*
Geometry - Alternate Angles

Description:
This function generates a problem related to alternate angles in geometry. It randomly generates angle values and constructs a question based on them. The function then provides the answer as well.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Alternate_angles();
console.log(result);
// Output: ['In the given diagram, if ∠3 and ∠4 are alternate angles, and the measure of ∠3 is 45 degrees, what is the measure of ∠4?', 'The measure of ∠4 is 45 degrees.']
// The question is regarding alternate angles, and the answer states the measure of ∠4.

$X.math.Middle_School_Mathematics.Geometry.Alternate_angles = function () {

    // Generate random angle values
    let angle3 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 90) + 1;
    let angle4 = angle3;

    // Construct the question and answer
    let question = "In the given diagram, if ∠3 and ∠4 are alternate angles, and the measure of ∠3 is " + angle3 + " degrees, what is the measure of ∠4?";
    let answer = "The measure of ∠4 is " + angle4 + " degrees.";

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
