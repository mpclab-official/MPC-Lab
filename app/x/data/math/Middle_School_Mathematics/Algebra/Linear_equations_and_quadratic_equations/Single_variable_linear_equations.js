/*
Single-Variable Linear Equations

Description:
This function generates single-variable linear equation problems of the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are random coefficients within the specified range. The function returns an array with the problem statement and the solution.

Inputs:
- min (number): The minimum value for the coefficients.
- max (number): The maximum value for the coefficients.
- add (boolean): Determines whether the operation is addition or not.
- sub (boolean): Determines whether the operation is subtraction or not.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the problem statement and the answer.

Example Usage:
const result = Single_variable_linear_equations(1, 5, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Solve the equation: 3x + 4 = 9.', 'x = 5/3']
// The problem is to solve the equation 3x + 4 = 9, and the solution is x = 5/3.
