/*
Classification of Matter

Description:
This function generates questions related to the classification of matter, covering various aspects such as the states of matter, chemical properties, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- statesOfMatter (boolean): Determines if questions related to states of matter should be included.
- chemicalProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to chemical properties should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ClassificationOfMatter(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the different states of matter?', 'The different states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.']
