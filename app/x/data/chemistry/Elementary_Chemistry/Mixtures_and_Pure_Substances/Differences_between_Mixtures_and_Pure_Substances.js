Differences between Mixtures and Pure Substances

Description:
This function generates questions related to the differences between mixtures and pure substances, covering various aspects such as their composition, properties, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- composition (boolean): Determines if questions related to composition should be included.
- properties (boolean): Determines if questions related to properties should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = DifferencesBetweenMixturesAndPureSubstances(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the primary difference between mixtures and pure substances in terms of composition?', 'The primary difference between mixtures and pure substances is that mixtures are composed of two or more different substances, whereas pure substances are composed of only one type of substance.']
