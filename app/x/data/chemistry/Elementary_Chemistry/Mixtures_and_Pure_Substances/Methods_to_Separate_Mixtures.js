Methods to Separate Mixtures

Description:
This function generates questions related to the methods used to separate mixtures, covering various separation techniques such as filtration, evaporation, crystallization, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- filtration (boolean): Determines if questions related to filtration should be included.
- evaporation (boolean): Determines if questions related to evaporation should be included.
- crystallization (boolean): Determines if questions related to crystallization should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MethodsToSeparateMixtures(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the process of crystallization used for?', 'The process of crystallization is used to separate a solid that has dissolved in a liquid by allowing the liquid to evaporate, leaving behind the solid in its crystalline form.']
