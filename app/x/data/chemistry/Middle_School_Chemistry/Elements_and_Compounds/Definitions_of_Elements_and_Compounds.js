/*
Definitions of Elements and Compounds

Description:
This function generates questions related to the definitions of elements and compounds, covering the basic definitions and differences between elements and compounds. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- elements (boolean): Determines if questions related to elements should be included.
- compounds (boolean): Determines if questions related to compounds should be included.
- differences (boolean): Determines if questions related to the differences between elements and compounds should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = DefinitionsOfElementsAndCompounds(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the primary difference between elements and compounds?', 'The primary difference between elements and compounds is that elements are made up of only one type of atom, whereas compounds are composed of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together.']
