Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties of acids and bases, covering their basic characteristics, common features, and their roles in chemical reactions. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- acidProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to acid properties should be included.
- baseProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to base properties should be included.
- rolesInReactions (boolean): Determines if questions related to the roles of acids and bases in reactions should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = PropertiesOfAcidsAndBases(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the typical properties of acids?', 'The typical properties of acids include a sour taste, the ability to turn blue litmus paper red, and the capacity to react with metals to produce hydrogen gas.']
