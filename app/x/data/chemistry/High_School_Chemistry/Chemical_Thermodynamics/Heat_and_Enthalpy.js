/*
Heat and Enthalpy

Description:
This function generates questions related to heat and enthalpy, covering the basic concepts of heat transfer, thermochemical equations, heat reactions, enthalpy changes, and related topics. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- heatTransfer (boolean): Determines if questions related to heat transfer should be included.
- thermochemicalEquations (boolean): Determines if questions related to thermochemical equations should be included.
- heatReactions (boolean): Determines if questions related to heat reactions should be included.
- enthalpyChanges (boolean): Determines if questions related to enthalpy changes should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = HeatAndEnthalpy(true, false, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the heat of reaction for the given thermochemical equation?', 'The heat of reaction for the given thermochemical equation is -342 kJ/mol.']
