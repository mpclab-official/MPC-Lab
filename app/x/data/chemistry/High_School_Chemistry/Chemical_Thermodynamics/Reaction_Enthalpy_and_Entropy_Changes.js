/*
Reaction Enthalpy and Entropy Changes

Description:
This function generates questions related to reaction enthalpy and entropy changes, covering the basic concepts of reaction enthalpy, entropy changes, and thermodynamics of reactions. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- reactionEnthalpy (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction enthalpy should be included.
- entropyChanges (boolean): Determines if questions related to entropy changes should be included.
- reactionThermodynamics (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction thermodynamics should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ReactionEnthalpyAndEntropyChanges(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the enthalpy change for the given reaction?', 'The enthalpy change for the given reaction is -325 kJ/mol.']
