Description:
This function generates questions related to covalent and ionic bonds, covering the basic concepts of bond formation, properties, and related topics. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- covalentBonds (boolean): Determines if questions related to covalent bonds should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = CovalentAndIonicBonds(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['How are covalent bonds formed?', 'Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.']
