/*
Atomic and Molecular Structure

Description:
This function generates questions related to the atomic and molecular structure, covering basic concepts of atomic structure, molecular composition, and related topics. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- atomicStructure (boolean): Determines if questions related to the basic concepts of atomic structure should be included.
- molecularComposition (boolean): Determines if questions related to the composition of molecules should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = AtomicAndMolecularStructure(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the basic structure of an atom?', 'The basic structure of an atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in energy levels.']
