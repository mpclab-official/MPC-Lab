/*
Reaction Rates and Activation Energy

Description:
This function generates questions related to reaction rates and activation energy, covering the basic concepts of reaction rates, factors influencing rates, and activation energy. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- reactionRates (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction rates should be included.
- activationEnergy (boolean): Determines if questions related to activation energy should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ReactionRatesAndActivationEnergy(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What factors can affect the rate of a chemical reaction?', 'Temperature, concentration, catalysts, and surface area are some factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction.']
