Inputs:
- equilibriumConstants (boolean): Determines if questions related to equilibrium constants should be included.
- leChateliersPrinciple (boolean): Determines if questions related to Le-Chatelier's Principle should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ChemicalEquilibriumAndLeChateliersPrinciple(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction?', 'The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction is Kc = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b.']

                "2": "An increase in pressure applied to a gaseous system at equilibrium will cause the system to shift in the direction that decreases the total number of moles of gas, reducing the pressure and restoring the equilibrium position.",
