Structure and Nomenclature of Organic Molecules

Description:
This function generates questions related to the structure and nomenclature of organic molecules, covering the basic concepts of organic chemistry, including molecular structures and naming rules.

Inputs:
- structure (boolean): Determines if questions related to molecular structure should be included.
- nomenclature (boolean): Determines if questions related to nomenclature should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = StructureAndNomenclatureOfOrganicMolecules(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the structure of the given organic molecule?', 'The structure of the given organic molecule is ...']
