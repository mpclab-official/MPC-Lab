Gravity and General Relativity

Description:
This function generates questions related to gravity and general relativity, covering various aspects such as the concept of gravity, the basic principles of general relativity, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- gravityConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the concept of gravity should be included.
- generalRelativityPrinciples (boolean): Determines if questions related to the principles of general relativity should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = GravityAndGeneralRelativity(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the principle of equivalence in general relativity?', 'The principle of equivalence states that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from those of acceleration.']
