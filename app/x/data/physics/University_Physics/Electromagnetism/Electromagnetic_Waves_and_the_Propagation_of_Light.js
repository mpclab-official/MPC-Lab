/*
Electromagnetic Waves and the Propagation of Light

Description:
This function generates questions related to electromagnetic waves and the propagation of light, covering various aspects such as wavelength, frequency, and propagation speed. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- wavelength (boolean): Determines if questions related to the wavelength of the waves should be included.
- frequency (boolean): Determines if questions related to the frequency of the waves should be included.
- propagationSpeed (boolean): Determines if questions related to the speed of propagation should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ElectromagneticWavesAndPropagation(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 5 Hz. What is its wavelength in a vacuum?', 'The wavelength of the wave is 60000 km.']
