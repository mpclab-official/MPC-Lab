Wave Functions and the Schrodinger Equation

Description:
This function generates questions related to wave functions and the Schrodinger equation, covering various aspects such as the properties of wave functions, applications of the Schrodinger equation, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- waveFunctionProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to the properties of wave functions should be included.
- schrodingerApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to the applications of the Schrodinger equation should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = WaveFunctionsAndSchrodingerEquation(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the normalization condition for a wave function?', 'The normalization condition for a wave function is ∫|Ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1.']
