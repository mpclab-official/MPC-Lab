/*
Matter and its Properties

Inputs:
- solid (boolean): Determines if questions related to solid matter should be included.
- liquid (boolean): Determines if questions related to liquid matter should be included.
- gas (boolean): Determines if questions related to gaseous matter should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties and characteristics of matter. It covers topics such as the states of matter, their properties, and basic concepts related to their behavior and characteristics.

Example Usage:
const result = Matter_Properties(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Solid matter has a fixed...', 'The molecules in a liquid...']
