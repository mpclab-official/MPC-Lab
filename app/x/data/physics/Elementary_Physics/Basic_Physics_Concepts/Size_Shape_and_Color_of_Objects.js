/*
Size, Shape, and Color of Objects

Inputs:
- size (boolean): Determines if questions related to the size of objects should be included.
- shape (boolean): Determines if questions related to the shapes of objects should be included.
- color (boolean): Determines if questions related to the colors of objects should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the size, shape, and color of various objects. It covers topics such as dimensions, geometrical forms, and color perception of different objects.

Example Usage:
const result = Size_Shape_Color_Objects(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the shape of...', 'The size of the object is...']

        'The primary colors present are carefully combined using additive or subtractive color mixing to achieve the perceived color.',
        'The color of the object enhances its visual appeal and ensures better visibility in different lighting conditions.',
        'The color serves as an indicator of the object`s brand identity and distinguishes it from similar products in the market.',
