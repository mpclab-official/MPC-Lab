/*
Position and Direction of Objects

Inputs:
- position (boolean): Determines if questions related to the position of objects should be included.
- direction (boolean): Determines if questions related to the direction of objects should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the positions and directions of objects. It covers topics such as spatial orientation, relative positions, and directional concepts of different objects.

Example Usage:
const result = Position_Direction_Objects(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Where is the object located?', 'The object is positioned...']
