/*
Mirrors and Lenses

Inputs:
- concaveMirror (boolean): Determines if questions related to concave mirrors should be included.
- convexMirror (boolean): Determines if questions related to convex mirrors should be included.
- concaveLens (boolean): Determines if questions related to concave lenses should be included.
- convexLens (boolean): Determines if questions related to convex lenses should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties and applications of mirrors and lenses, including concave and convex mirrors and lenses. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = MirrorsAndLenses(true, false, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['A concave lens has a focal length of 15 cm. What is its power?', 'The power of the concave lens is -6.67 diopters.']
