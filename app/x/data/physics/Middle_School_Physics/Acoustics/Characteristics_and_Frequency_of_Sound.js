/*
Characteristics and Frequency of Sound

Inputs:
- pitch (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound pitch should be included.
- frequency (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound frequency should be included.
- characteristics (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound characteristics should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the characteristics and frequency of sound. It covers topics such as sound pitch, frequency, and the characteristics of sound waves. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Characteristics_and_Frequency_of_Sound(true, true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the pitch of a sound wave with a frequency of 440 Hz?', 'The pitch of a sound wave with a frequency of 440 Hz is A4.']
