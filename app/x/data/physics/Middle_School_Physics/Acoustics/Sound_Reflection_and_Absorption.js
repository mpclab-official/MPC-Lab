/*
Sound Reflection and Absorption

Inputs:
- reflection (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound reflection should be included.
- absorption (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound absorption should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to sound reflection and absorption. It covers topics such as the behavior of sound waves upon reflection and the process of sound absorption. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Sound_Reflection_and_Absorption(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the percentage of sound absorbed by the surface with an absorption coefficient of 0.6?', 'The surface with an absorption coefficient of 0.6 absorbs 60% of the sound.']
