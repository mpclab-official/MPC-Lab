/*
Propagation of Sound

Inputs:
- medium (boolean): Determines if questions related to sound propagation in different media should be included.
- speed (boolean): Determines if questions related to the speed of sound should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the propagation of sound waves through different media. It covers topics such as the speed of sound in various materials, the factors affecting the speed of sound, and the behavior of sound in different environments. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Propagation_of_Sound(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the speed of sound in water?', 'The speed of sound in water is approximately 1482 meters per second at 25 degrees Celsius.']
