/*
Magnetic Fields and Electromagnetic Induction

Inputs:
- fields (boolean): Determines if questions related to magnetic fields should be included.
- induction (boolean): Determines if questions related to electromagnetic induction should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the concept of magnetic fields and electromagnetic induction. It covers topics such as the properties of magnetic fields, the behavior of magnetic materials, electromagnetic waves, and practical applications of electromagnetic induction. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Magnetic_Fields_and_Electromagnetic_Induction(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the relationship between magnetic flux and the induced electromotive force?', 'The relationship is defined by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.']
