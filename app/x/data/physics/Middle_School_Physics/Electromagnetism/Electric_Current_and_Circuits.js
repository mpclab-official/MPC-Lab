Electric Current and Circuits

Inputs:
- current (boolean): Determines if questions related to electric current should be included.
- circuits (boolean): Determines if questions related to electric circuits should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the concept of electric current and circuits. It covers topics such as Ohm's law, electrical components, circuit diagrams, and practical applications of electric circuits. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Electric_Current_and_Circuits(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance?', 'The relationship is defined by Ohm's law, which states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) between them.']
