Electric Charge and Static Electricity

Inputs:
- charge (boolean): Determines if questions related to electric charge should be included.
- staticElectricity (boolean): Determines if questions related to static electricity should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the concept of electric charge and static electricity. It covers topics such as charge interactions, charging by friction, induction, and practical applications of static electricity. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Electric_Charge_and_Static_Electricity(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the basic unit of electric charge?', 'The basic unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C).']
