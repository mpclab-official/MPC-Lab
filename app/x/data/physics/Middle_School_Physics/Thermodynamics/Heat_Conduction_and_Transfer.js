/*
Heat Conduction and Transfer

Inputs:
- conduction (boolean): Determines if questions related to heat conduction should be included.
- transfer (boolean): Determines if questions related to heat transfer should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the concepts of heat conduction and heat transfer. It covers topics such as conductors, insulators, and different methods of heat transfer. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Heat_Conduction_and_Transfer(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Explain the concept of heat transfer.', 'Heat transfer refers to the process of thermal energy moving from a hotter object to a cooler one.']
